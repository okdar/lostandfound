# Lost and Found - Garmin Widget

Have you misplaced or forgotten your Garmin device? If so, don't worry - there is an opportunity to retrieve it. This helpful widget provides your contact information, enabling the finder to connect with you and ensure the safe return of your device.

Upon installing the widget, make sure to input your contact information in the widget settings.

The Lost and Found widget, along with all my other Garmin projects (accessible here: https://okdar.github.io/smartarcs/), are available at no cost. If you appreciate my efforts, please consider making a donation at https://paypal.me/RadkoNajman. Your donation not only expresses appreciation for my work but also contributes to a good cause - I support non-profit organizations with these funds.
